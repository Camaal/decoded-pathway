They also value Relationships, Supportin the workplace. They leverage knowledge in Production and Processing to do their job well.  Their average day consists of the following activities Monitoring Processes, Materials, or Surroundings, Identifying Objects, Actions, and Events, Inspecting Equipment, Structures, or Materials, Estimating the Quantifiable Characteristics of Products, Events, or Information, Judging the Qualities of Objects, Services, or People, Performing General Physical Activities, Handling and Moving Objects, Controlling Machines and Processes, Communicating with Supervisors, Peers, or Subordinates, Establishing and Maintaining Interpersonal Relationships. To identify jobs that transfer from their previous job and experience, we created a matching algorithm that finds the 1 to 10 related occupations someone can pursue with minimal additional preparation. By comparing the Cutters and Trimmers, Hand occupation to all other occupations' attributes (knowledge, skills, work activities, etc.), we found that it is similar to the following occupations: Machine Feeders and Offbearers, Textile Knitting and Weaving Machine Setters, Operators, and Tenders, Shoe Machine Operators and Tenders, Postal Service Mail Sorters, Processors, and Processing Machine Operators, Helpers--Production Workers. By converting occupation relationships into a network graph and measuring the centrality of each occupation, this occupation would create opportunities for people to transition into 5.0 other occupations (also known as outdegree). On the other hand, 5.0 other occupations transition into it, which gives you an idea of how specialized it may be. The path begins with Cutters and Trimmers, Hand.

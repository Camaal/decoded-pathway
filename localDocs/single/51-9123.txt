They also value Supportin the workplace.   Their average day consists of the following activities Getting Information, Monitoring Processes, Materials, or Surroundings, Identifying Objects, Actions, and Events, Inspecting Equipment, Structures, or Materials, Processing Information, Evaluating Information to Determine Compliance with Standards, Making Decisions and Solving Problems, Updating and Using Relevant Knowledge, Handling and Moving Objects, Communicating with Supervisors, Peers, or Subordinates, Training and Teaching Others, Monitoring and Controlling Resources. To identify jobs that transfer from their previous job and experience, we created a matching algorithm that finds the 1 to 10 related occupations someone can pursue with minimal additional preparation. By comparing the Painting, Coating, and Decorating Workers occupation to all other occupations' attributes (knowledge, skills, work activities, etc.), we found that it is similar to the following occupations: Stockers and Order Fillers, Welders, Cutters, Solderers, and Brazers, Helpers--Production Workers, Machine Feeders and Offbearers, Shoe and Leather Workers and Repairers. By converting occupation relationships into a network graph and measuring the centrality of each occupation, this occupation would create opportunities for people to transition into 5.0 other occupations (also known as outdegree). On the other hand, 5.0 other occupations transition into it, which gives you an idea of how specialized it may be. The path begins with Painting, Coating, and Decorating Workers.

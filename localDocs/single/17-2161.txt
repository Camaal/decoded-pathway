People would describe them as Realistic, Investigative, Conventional. They also tend to focus on the following opportunities at work: Achievement/Effort, Persistence, Initiative, Leadership, Cooperation, Self-Control, Stress Tolerance, Adaptability/Flexibility, Dependability, Attention to Detail, Integrity, Analytical Thinking. They also value Achievement, Working Conditions, Recognition, Support, Independencein the workplace. They leverage knowledge in Administration and Management, Computers and Electronics, Engineering and Technology, Design, Building and Construction, Mechanical, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Education and Training, English Language, Public Safety and Security, Law and Government to do their job well. They employ the following skills Reading Comprehension, Active Listening, Writing, Speaking, Mathematics, Science, Critical Thinking, Active Learning, Learning Strategies, Monitoring, Social Perceptiveness, Coordination, Persuasion, Instructing, Complex Problem Solving, Operations Analysis, Operations Monitoring, Quality Control Analysis, Judgment and Decision Making, Systems Analysis, Systems Evaluation, Time Management. Their average day consists of the following activities Getting Information, Monitoring Processes, Materials, or Surroundings, Identifying Objects, Actions, and Events, Inspecting Equipment, Structures, or Materials, Estimating the Quantifiable Characteristics of Products, Events, or Information, Judging the Qualities of Objects, Services, or People, Processing Information, Evaluating Information to Determine Compliance with Standards, Analyzing Data or Information, Making Decisions and Solving Problems, Thinking Creatively, Updating and Using Relevant Knowledge, Developing Objectives and Strategies, Scheduling Work and Activities, Organizing, Planning, and Prioritizing Work, Controlling Machines and Processes, Working with Computers, Drafting, Laying Out, and Specifying Technical Devices, Parts, and Equipment, Documenting/Recording Information, Interpreting the Meaning of Information for Others, Communicating with Supervisors, Peers, or Subordinates, Communicating with People Outside the Organization, Establishing and Maintaining Interpersonal Relationships, Coordinating the Work and Activities of Others, Developing and Building Teams, Training and Teaching Others, Guiding, Directing, and Motivating Subordinates, Coaching and Developing Others, Providing Consultation and Advice to Others. To identify jobs that transfer from their previous job and experience, we created a matching algorithm that finds the 1 to 10 related occupations someone can pursue with minimal additional preparation. By comparing the Nuclear Engineers occupation to all other occupations' attributes (knowledge, skills, work activities, etc.), we found that it is similar to the following occupations: Materials Scientists, Nanosystems Engineers, Microsystems Engineers, Hydrologists, Human Factors Engineers and Ergonomists. By converting occupation relationships into a network graph and measuring the centrality of each occupation, this occupation would create opportunities for people to transition into 6.0 other occupations (also known as outdegree). On the other hand, 6.0 other occupations transition into it, which gives you an idea of how specialized it may be.  According to ONET survey research, 85% feel this occupation requires a Bachelor's Degree Educational programs associated with this occupation tend to graduate people with the following degrees: Postbaccalaureate certificate, Master’s degree, Doctor’s degree-research/scholarship, Bachelor's degree, Postsecondary awards, certificates, or diplomas (900hrs), Post-master’s certificate, Postsecondary awards, certificates, or diplomas (300hrs), Associate's degree. Among black students completing instructional programs related to this occupation, 0% received a Associate's degree, 10% received a Bachelor's degree, 2% received a Doctor’s degree-research/scholarship, 2% received a Master’s degree, 0% received a Post-master’s certificate, 0% received a Postbaccalaureate certificate, 2% received a Postsecondary awards, certificates, or diplomas (300hrs), ?.

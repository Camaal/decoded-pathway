"A Metal-Refining Furnace Operators and Tenders is someone who Operate or tend furnaces, such as gas, oil, coal, electric-arc or electric induction, open-hearth, or oxygen furnaces, to melt and refine metal before casting or to produce specified types of steel. . The Metal-Refining Furnace Operators and Tenders  occupation fits a more significant career segment of Production Occupations. This occupation is considered part of job zone 2, described as occupations that need some preparation. You can find this occupation in the following industries: Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction, Wholesale Trade, Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services, Manufacturing. People who work in this occupation are responsible for the following tasks: Regulate supplies of fuel and air, or control flow of electric current and water coolant to heat furnaces and adjust temperatures., Draw smelted metal samples from furnaces or kettles for analysis, and calculate types and amounts of materials needed to ensure that materials meet specifications., Weigh materials to be charged into furnaces, using scales., Record production data, and maintain production logs., Observe air and temperature gauges or metal color and fluidity, and turn fuel valves or adjust controls to maintain required temperatures., Operate controls to move or discharge metal workpieces from furnaces., Inspect furnaces and equipment to locate defects and wear., Drain, transfer, or remove molten metal from furnaces, and place it into molds, using hoists, pumps, or ladles., Kindle fires, and shovel fuel and other materials into furnaces or onto conveyors by hand, with hoists, or by directing crane operators., Prepare material to load into furnaces, including cleaning, crushing, or applying chemicals, by using crushing machines, shovels, rakes, or sprayers., Remove impurities from the surface of molten metal, using strainers., Observe operations inside furnaces, using television screens, to ensure that problems do not occur., Sprinkle chemicals over molten metal to bring impurities to the surface., Direct work crews in the cleaning and repair of furnace walls and flooring., Scrape accumulations of metal oxides from floors, molds, and crucibles, and sift and store them for reclamation..  They also know about using the following technology: Spreadsheet software, Office suite software, Industrial control software, Data base user interface and query software, Inventory management software. Examples include Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Office software, Process control software, Process safety management software, Production tracking system software.

They also tend to excel in the following abilities: Oral Expression, Problem Sensitivity, Deductive Reasoning, Information Ordering, Perceptual Speed, Selective Attention, Arm-Hand Steadiness, Manual Dexterity, Finger Dexterity, Control Precision, Multilimb Coordination, Rate Control, Reaction Time, Static Strength, Trunk Strength, Extent Flexibility, Near Vision, Depth Perception, Hearing Sensitivity, Auditory Attention. People would describe them as Realistic, Conventional. They also tend to focus on the following opportunities at work: Achievement/Effort, Persistence, Initiative, Leadership, Cooperation, Concern for Others, Social Orientation, Self-Control, Stress Tolerance, Adaptability/Flexibility, Dependability, Attention to Detail, Integrity, Independence, Innovation, Analytical Thinking. They also value Support, Independencein the workplace. They leverage knowledge in Administration and Management, Production and Processing, Mechanical, Education and Training, Public Safety and Security to do their job well. They employ the following skills Active Listening, Critical Thinking, Monitoring, Operations Monitoring, Operation and Control, Quality Control Analysis. Their average day consists of the following activities Getting Information, Monitoring Processes, Materials, or Surroundings, Identifying Objects, Actions, and Events, Inspecting Equipment, Structures, or Materials, Estimating the Quantifiable Characteristics of Products, Events, or Information, Judging the Qualities of Objects, Services, or People, Processing Information, Evaluating Information to Determine Compliance with Standards, Analyzing Data or Information, Making Decisions and Solving Problems, Thinking Creatively, Updating and Using Relevant Knowledge, Scheduling Work and Activities, Organizing, Planning, and Prioritizing Work, Performing General Physical Activities, Handling and Moving Objects, Controlling Machines and Processes, Operating Vehicles, Mechanized Devices, or Equipment, Repairing and Maintaining Mechanical Equipment, Documenting/Recording Information, Communicating with Supervisors, Peers, or Subordinates, Establishing and Maintaining Interpersonal Relationships, Coordinating the Work and Activities of Others, Training and Teaching Others. To identify jobs that transfer from their previous job and experience, we created a matching algorithm that finds the 1 to 10 related occupations someone can pursue with minimal additional preparation. By comparing the Metal-Refining Furnace Operators and Tenders occupation to all other occupations' attributes (knowledge, skills, work activities, etc.), we found that it is similar to the following occupations: Maintenance Workers, Machinery, Crane and Tower Operators, Industrial Machinery Mechanics, Machinists, Boilermakers. By converting occupation relationships into a network graph and measuring the centrality of each occupation, this occupation would create opportunities for people to transition into 5.0 other occupations (also known as outdegree). On the other hand, 5.0 other occupations transition into it, which gives you an idea of how specialized it may be.  "

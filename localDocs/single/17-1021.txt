To identify jobs that transfer from their previous job and experience, we created a matching algorithm that finds the 1 to 10 related occupations someone can pursue with minimal additional preparation. By comparing the Cartographers and Photogrammetrists occupation to all other occupations' attributes (knowledge, skills, work activities, etc.), we found that it is similar to the following occupations: Librarians and Media Collections Specialists, Survey Researchers, Teaching Assistants, Postsecondary, Geoscientists, Except Hydrologists and Geographers, Climate Change Policy Analysts. By converting occupation relationships into a network graph and measuring the centrality of each occupation, this occupation would create opportunities for people to transition into 12.0 other occupations (also known as outdegree). On the other hand, 12.0 other occupations transition into it, which gives you an idea of how specialized it may be.  "

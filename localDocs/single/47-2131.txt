The Insulation Workers, Floor, Ceiling, and Wall  occupation fits a more significant career segment of Construction and Extraction Occupations. This occupation is considered part of job zone 2, described as occupations that need some preparation. You can find this occupation in the following industries: Construction, Wholesale Trade, Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services, Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services, Educational Services, Health Care and Social Assistance, Other Services (except Public Administration), Manufacturing, Retail Trade. People who work in this occupation are responsible for the following tasks: Measure and cut insulation for covering surfaces, using tape measures, handsaws, power saws, knives, or scissors., Fit, wrap, staple, or glue insulating materials to structures or surfaces, using hand tools or wires., Cover and line structures with blown or rolled forms of materials to insulate against cold, heat, or moisture, using saws, knives, rasps, trowels, blowers, or other tools and implements., Distribute insulating materials evenly into small spaces within floors, ceilings, or walls, using blowers and hose attachments, or cement mortars., Move controls, buttons, or levers to start blowers and regulate flow of materials through nozzles., Fill blower hoppers with insulating materials., Cover, seal, or finish insulated surfaces or access holes with plastic covers, canvas strips, sealants, tape, cement or asphalt mastic., Read blueprints, and select appropriate insulation, based on space characteristics and the heat retaining or excluding characteristics of the material., Remove old insulation, such as asbestos, following safety procedures., Prepare surfaces for insulation application by brushing or spreading on adhesives, cement, or asphalt, or by attaching metal pins to surfaces..

They also value Supportin the workplace. They leverage knowledge in Building and Construction, Mechanical to do their job well. They employ the following skills Operation and Control. Their average day consists of the following activities Getting Information, Monitoring Processes, Materials, or Surroundings, Identifying Objects, Actions, and Events, Inspecting Equipment, Structures, or Materials, Making Decisions and Solving Problems, Thinking Creatively, Updating and Using Relevant Knowledge, Performing General Physical Activities, Handling and Moving Objects, Controlling Machines and Processes, Operating Vehicles, Mechanized Devices, or Equipment, Repairing and Maintaining Mechanical Equipment, Communicating with Supervisors, Peers, or Subordinates. To identify jobs that transfer from their previous job and experience, we created a matching algorithm that finds the 1 to 10 related occupations someone can pursue with minimal additional preparation. By comparing the Insulation Workers, Floor, Ceiling, and Wall occupation to all other occupations' attributes (knowledge, skills, work activities, etc.), we found that it is similar to the following occupations: Structural Metal Fabricators and Fitters, Maintenance Workers, Machinery, Plumbers, Pipefitters, and Steamfitters, Crane and Tower Operators, Stonemasons. By converting occupation relationships into a network graph and measuring the centrality of each occupation, this occupation would create opportunities for people to transition into 8.0 other occupations (also known as outdegree). On the other hand, 8.0 other occupations transition into it, which gives you an idea of how specialized it may be. The path begins with Insulation Workers, Floor, Ceiling, and Wall.

To identify jobs that transfer from their previous job and experience, we created a matching algorithm that finds the 1 to 10 related occupations someone can pursue with minimal additional preparation. By comparing the Gas Plant Operators occupation to all other occupations' attributes (knowledge, skills, work activities, etc.), we found that it is similar to the following occupations: Water and Wastewater Treatment Plant and System Operators, Stationary Engineers and Boiler Operators, Electrical and Electronics Repairers, Powerhouse, Substation, and Relay, Automotive Engineering Technicians, Control and Valve Installers and Repairers, Except Mechanical Door. By converting occupation relationships into a network graph and measuring the centrality of each occupation, this occupation would create opportunities for people to transition into 5.0 other occupations (also known as outdegree). On the other hand, 5.0 other occupations transition into it, which gives you an idea of how specialized it may be.  "

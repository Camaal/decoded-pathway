To identify jobs that transfer from their previous job and experience, we created a matching algorithm that finds the 1 to 10 related occupations someone can pursue with minimal additional preparation. By comparing the Marine Engineers and Naval Architects occupation to all other occupations' attributes (knowledge, skills, work activities, etc.), we found that it is similar to the following occupations: Microsystems Engineers, Human Factors Engineers and Ergonomists, Materials Scientists, Architectural and Engineering Managers, Nanosystems Engineers. By converting occupation relationships into a network graph and measuring the centrality of each occupation, this occupation would create opportunities for people to transition into 12.0 other occupations (also known as outdegree). On the other hand, 12.0 other occupations transition into it, which gives you an idea of how specialized it may be. The path begins with Marine Engineers and Naval Architects.

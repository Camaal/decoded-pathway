To identify jobs that transfer from their previous job and experience, we created a matching algorithm that finds the 1 to 10 related occupations someone can pursue with minimal additional preparation. By comparing the Nanotechnology Engineering Technologists and Technicians occupation to all other occupations' attributes (knowledge, skills, work activities, etc.), we found that it is similar to the following occupations: Materials Scientists, Nanosystems Engineers, Microsystems Engineers, Microbiologists, Hydrologists. By converting occupation relationships into a network graph and measuring the centrality of each occupation, this occupation would create opportunities for people to transition into 46.0 other occupations (also known as outdegree). On the other hand, 46.0 other occupations transition into it, which gives you an idea of how specialized it may be. The path begins with Nanotechnology Engineering Technologists and Technicians.

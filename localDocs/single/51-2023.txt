"A Electromechanical Equipment Assemblers is someone who Assemble or modify electromechanical equipment or devices, such as servomechanisms, gyros, dynamometers, magnetic drums, tape drives, brakes, control linkage, actuators, and appliances. . The Electromechanical Equipment Assemblers  occupation fits a more significant career segment of Production Occupations. This occupation is considered part of job zone 2, described as occupations that need some preparation.  People who work in this occupation are responsible for the following tasks: Inspect, test, and adjust completed units to ensure that units meet specifications, tolerances, and customer order requirements., Position, align, and adjust parts for proper fit and assembly., Assemble parts or units, and position, align, and fasten units to assemblies, subassemblies, or frames, using hand tools and power tools., Connect cables, tubes, and wiring, according to specifications., Measure parts to determine tolerances, using precision measuring instruments such as micrometers, calipers, and verniers., Read blueprints and specifications to determine component parts and assembly sequences of electromechanical units., Attach name plates and mark identifying information on parts., Disassemble units to replace parts or to crate them for shipping., File, lap, and buff parts to fit, using hand and power tools., Clean and lubricate parts and subassemblies, using grease paddles or oilcans., Operate or tend automated assembling equipment, such as robotics and fixed automation equipment., Drill, tap, ream, countersink, and spot-face bolt holes in parts, using drill presses and portable power drills., Operate small cranes to transport or position large parts., Pack or fold insulation between panels..  They also know about using the following technology: Computer aided design CAD software, Graphics or photo imaging software, Spreadsheet software, Office suite software, Word processing software, Enterprise resource planning ERP software, Time accounting software. Examples include Autodesk AutoCAD, Blueprint display software, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Office software, Microsoft Word, SAP software, Timekeeping software. People in the occupation are comfortable using the following tools: Power buffers, C clamps, Hoists, Chalk lines, Claw hammer, Combination pliers, Pullers, Miscellaneous assembly machines, Manual press brake, Calipers, Dynamometers, Micrometers, Oscilloscopes, Electronic actuators, Wire brushes, Power sanders, Soldering iron, Flat hand file, Grease guns, Rasps, Gyroscopic instruments, Hand reamer, Power grinders, Wire lug crimping tool, Binocular light compound microscopes, Ratchets, Drill press or radial drill, Cold chisels, Shears, Power saws, Multimeters, Combination wrenches, Squares, Personal computers, Threading taps, Plumb bobs, Rivet tools, Power drills, Hydraulic press brake, Levels, Rulers, Sledge hammer, Socket sets, Spot welding machine, Wedges, Screwdrivers, Temperature cycle chamber, Circuit tester, Torque wrenches, Height gauges, Wire cutters, Specialty assembly, Positioning jig, Bench vises. For example, Buffing wheels, C clamps, Chain falls, Chalk line markers, Claw hammers, Combination pliers, Comealongs, Component insertion machines, Cornice brakes, Digital calipers, Digital dynamometers, Digital micrometers, Digital oscilloscopes, Dynamic actuators, Electric hoists, Electric rotary wire brushes, Electric sanders, Electric soldering irons, Flat hand-held files, Grease paddles, Grinding rasps, Gyroscopes, Hand reamers, Handheld grinders, Hydraulic crimpers, Inspection microscopes, Locking ratchet wrenches, Magnetic drill presses, Metal chisels, Metal shears, Metal-cutting bandsaws, Multifunction digital multimeters, Multipurpose wrenches, Nail pullers, Optical squares, Personal computers, Pipe taps, Plumb lines, Pneumatic riveters, Portable power drills, Power brakes, Precision levels, Precision rulers, Punch presses, Sledgehammers, Socket wrench sets, Spot welding tools, Steel wedges, Straight screwdrivers, Temperature testers, Test lights, Torque drivers, Vernier calipers, Vernier height gauges, Wire cutting tools, Wire-routing tools, Workpiece positioning jigs, Workshop bench vises. They also tend to excel in the following abilities: Oral Comprehension, Problem Sensitivity, Deductive Reasoning, Inductive Reasoning, Information Ordering, Category Flexibility, Visualization, Arm-Hand Steadiness, Manual Dexterity, Finger Dexterity, Control Precision, Near Vision, Far Vision. People would describe them as Realistic, Investigative, Conventional. They also tend to focus on the following opportunities at work: Achievement/Effort, Persistence, Initiative, Cooperation, Concern for Others, Social Orientation, Self-Control, Stress Tolerance, Adaptability/Flexibility, Dependability, Attention to Detail, Integrity, Independence, Innovation, Analytical Thinking. They also value Relationships, Supportin the workplace. They leverage knowledge in Production and Processing, Computers and Electronics, Engineering and Technology, Mechanical to do their job well. They employ the following skills Reading Comprehension, Operations Monitoring, Troubleshooting, Quality Control Analysis. Their average day consists of the following activities Getting Information, Monitoring Processes, Materials, or Surroundings, Identifying Objects, Actions, and Events, Inspecting Equipment, Structures, or Materials, Estimating the Quantifiable Characteristics of Products, Events, or Information, Judging the Qualities of Objects, Services, or People, Processing Information, Evaluating Information to Determine Compliance with Standards, Analyzing Data or Information, Making Decisions and Solving Problems, Updating and Using Relevant Knowledge, Organizing, Planning, and Prioritizing Work, Performing General Physical Activities, Handling and Moving Objects, Controlling Machines and Processes, Documenting/Recording Information, Communicating with Supervisors, Peers, or Subordinates, Establishing and Maintaining Interpersonal Relationships. To identify jobs that transfer from their previous job and experience, we created a matching algorithm that finds the 1 to 10 related occupations someone can pursue with minimal additional preparation. By comparing the Electromechanical Equipment Assemblers occupation to all other occupations' attributes (knowledge, skills, work activities, etc.), we found that it is similar to the following occupations: Machinists, Patternmakers, Metal and Plastic, Model Makers, Metal and Plastic, Tool and Die Makers, Industrial Machinery Mechanics. By converting occupation relationships into a network graph and measuring the centrality of each occupation, this occupation would create opportunities for people to transition into 5.0 other occupations (also known as outdegree). On the other hand, 5.0 other occupations transition into it, which gives you an idea of how specialized it may be.  "

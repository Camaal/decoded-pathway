"A Coil Winders, Tapers, and Finishers is someone who Wind wire coils used in electrical components, such as resistors and transformers, and in electrical equipment and instruments, such as field cores, bobbins, armature cores, electrical motors, generators, and control equipment. . The Coil Winders, Tapers, and Finishers  occupation fits a more significant career segment of Production Occupations. This occupation is considered part of job zone 2, described as occupations that need some preparation. You can find this occupation in the following industries: Wholesale Trade, Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services, Other Services (except Public Administration), Manufacturing. People who work in this occupation are responsible for the following tasks: Operate or tend wire-coiling machines to wind wire coils used in electrical components such as resistors and transformers, and in electrical equipment and instruments such as bobbins and generators., Attach, alter, and trim materials such as wire, insulation, and coils, using hand tools., Cut, strip, and bend wire leads at ends of coils, using pliers and wire scrapers., Review work orders and specifications to determine materials needed and types of parts to be processed., Select and load materials such as workpieces, objects, and machine parts onto equipment used in coiling processes., Record production and operational data on specified forms., Stop machines to remove completed components, using hand tools., Examine and test wired electrical components such as motors, armatures, and stators, using measuring devices, and record test results., Line slots with sheet insulation, and insert coils into slots., Apply solutions or paints to wired electrical components, using hand tools, and bake components., Disassemble and assemble motors, and repair and maintain electrical components and machinery parts, using hand tools..

They also value Supportin the workplace. They leverage knowledge in Administration and Management, Production and Processing, Computers and Electronics, Design, Mechanical, Mathematics, Physics, Education and Training, English Language to do their job well. They employ the following skills Monitoring, Operations Monitoring, Operation and Control. Their average day consists of the following activities Getting Information, Monitoring Processes, Materials, or Surroundings, Identifying Objects, Actions, and Events, Inspecting Equipment, Structures, or Materials, Estimating the Quantifiable Characteristics of Products, Events, or Information, Judging the Qualities of Objects, Services, or People, Processing Information, Evaluating Information to Determine Compliance with Standards, Making Decisions and Solving Problems, Updating and Using Relevant Knowledge, Scheduling Work and Activities, Organizing, Planning, and Prioritizing Work, Performing General Physical Activities, Handling and Moving Objects, Controlling Machines and Processes, Communicating with Supervisors, Peers, or Subordinates, Establishing and Maintaining Interpersonal Relationships, Training and Teaching Others, Coaching and Developing Others. To identify jobs that transfer from their previous job and experience, we created a matching algorithm that finds the 1 to 10 related occupations someone can pursue with minimal additional preparation. By comparing the Coil Winders, Tapers, and Finishers occupation to all other occupations' attributes (knowledge, skills, work activities, etc.), we found that it is similar to the following occupations: Structural Metal Fabricators and Fitters, Machinists, Patternmakers, Metal and Plastic, Jewelers and Precious Stone and Metal Workers, Maintenance Workers, Machinery. By converting occupation relationships into a network graph and measuring the centrality of each occupation, this occupation would create opportunities for people to transition into 5.0 other occupations (also known as outdegree). On the other hand, 5.0 other occupations transition into it, which gives you an idea of how specialized it may be.  "

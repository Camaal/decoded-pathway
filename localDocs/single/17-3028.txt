"A Calibration Technologists and Technicians is someone who Execute or adapt procedures and techniques for calibrating measurement devices, by applying knowledge of measurement science, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and electronics, sometimes under the direction of engineering staff. Determine measurement standard suitability for calibrating measurement devices. May perform preventive maintenance on equipment. May perform corrective actions to address identified calibration problems. . The Calibration Technologists and Technicians  occupation fits a more significant career segment of Architecture and Engineering Occupations. This occupation is considered part of job zone 3, described as occupations that need medium preparation.  People who work in this occupation are responsible for the following tasks: Analyze test data to identify defects or determine calibration requirements., Attend conferences, workshops, or other training sessions to learn about new tools or methods., Calibrate devices by comparing measurements of pressure, temperature, humidity, or other environmental conditions to known standards., Conduct calibration tests to determine performance or reliability of mechanical, structural, or electromechanical equipment., Develop new calibration methods or techniques based on measurement science, analyses, or calibration requirements., Disassemble and reassemble equipment for inspection., Draw plans for developing jigs, fixtures, instruments, or other devices., Maintain or repair measurement devices or equipment used for calibration testing., Operate metalworking machines to fabricate housings, jigs, fittings, or fixtures., Order replacement parts for malfunctioning equipment., Plan sequences of calibration tests according to equipment specifications and scientific principles., Read blueprints, schematics, diagrams, or technical orders., Verify part dimensions or clearances using precision measuring instruments to ensure conformance to specifications., Visually inspect equipment to detect surface defects., Write and submit reports about the results of calibration tests..  They also know about using the following technology: Operating system software, Computer aided design CAD software, Project management software, Analytical or scientific software, Development environment software. Examples include Apple macOS, Autodesk AutoCAD, Autodesk AutoCAD Civil 3D, Bentley MicroStation, Dassault Systemes SolidWorks, Linux, Microsoft Project, Minitab, National Instruments LabVIEW.   People would describe them as Realistic, Investigative, Conventional.         "

"A Medical Dosimetrists is someone who Generate radiation treatment plans, develop radiation dose calculations, communicate and supervise the treatment plan implementation, and consult with members of radiation oncology team. . The Medical Dosimetrists  occupation fits a more significant career segment of Healthcare Practitioners and Technical Occupations. This occupation is considered part of job zone 3, described as occupations that need medium preparation.  People who work in this occupation are responsible for the following tasks: Advise oncology team members on use of beam modifying or immobilization devices in radiation treatment plans., Calculate, or verify calculations of, prescribed radiation doses., Calculate the delivery of radiation treatment, such as the amount or extent of radiation per session, based on the prescribed course of radiation therapy., Conduct radiation oncology-related research, such as improving computer treatment planning systems or developing new treatment devices., Create and transfer reference images and localization markers for treatment delivery, using image-guided radiation therapy., Design the arrangement of radiation fields to reduce exposure to critical patient structures, such as organs, using computers, manuals, and guides., Develop radiation treatment plans in consultation with members of the radiation oncology team., Develop requirements for the use of patient immobilization devices and positioning aides, such as molds or casts, as part of treatment plans to ensure accurate delivery of radiation and comfort of patient., Develop treatment plans, and calculate doses for brachytherapy procedures., Educate patients regarding treatment plans, physiological reactions to treatment, or post-treatment care., Fabricate beam modifying devices, such as compensators, shields, and wedge filters., Fabricate patient immobilization devices, such as molds or casts, for radiation delivery., Identify and outline bodily structures, using imaging procedures, such as x-ray, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, or positron emission tomography., Load, receive, or ship radioactive materials., Measure the amount of radioactivity in patients or equipment, using radiation monitoring devices., Perform quality assurance system checks, such as calibrations, on treatment planning computers., Plan the use of beam modifying devices, such as compensators, shields, and wedge filters, to ensure safe and effective delivery of radiation treatment., Record patient information, such as radiation doses administered, in patient records., Supervise or perform simulations for tumor localizations, using imaging methods such as magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, or positron emission tomography scans., Teach medical dosimetry, including its application, to students, radiation therapists, or residents..  They also know about using the following technology: Medical software. Examples include Medical condition coding software, MEDITECH software.   People would describe them as Realistic, Investigative, Social, Conventional.         "

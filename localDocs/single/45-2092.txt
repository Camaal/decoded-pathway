To identify jobs that transfer from their previous job and experience, we created a matching algorithm that finds the 1 to 10 related occupations someone can pursue with minimal additional preparation. By comparing the Farmworkers and Laborers, Crop, Nursery, and Greenhouse occupation to all other occupations' attributes (knowledge, skills, work activities, etc.), we found that it is similar to the following occupations: Farmworkers, Farm, Ranch, and Aquacultural Animals, Welding, Soldering, and Brazing Machine Setters, Operators, and Tenders, Recycling and Reclamation Workers, Helpers--Production Workers, Cleaners of Vehicles and Equipment. By converting occupation relationships into a network graph and measuring the centrality of each occupation, this occupation would create opportunities for people to transition into 5.0 other occupations (also known as outdegree). On the other hand, 5.0 other occupations transition into it, which gives you an idea of how specialized it may be. The path begins with Farmworkers and Laborers, Crop, Nursery, and Greenhouse.

To identify jobs that transfer from their previous job and experience, we created a matching algorithm that finds the 1 to 10 related occupations someone can pursue with minimal additional preparation. By comparing the Pressers, Textile, Garment, and Related Materials occupation to all other occupations' attributes (knowledge, skills, work activities, etc.), we found that it is similar to the following occupations: Machine Feeders and Offbearers, Welders, Cutters, Solderers, and Brazers, Helpers--Production Workers, Textile Knitting and Weaving Machine Setters, Operators, and Tenders, Slaughterers and Meat Packers. By converting occupation relationships into a network graph and measuring the centrality of each occupation, this occupation would create opportunities for people to transition into 5.0 other occupations (also known as outdegree). On the other hand, 5.0 other occupations transition into it, which gives you an idea of how specialized it may be. The path begins with Pressers, Textile, Garment, and Related Materials.

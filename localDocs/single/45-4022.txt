To identify jobs that transfer from their previous job and experience, we created a matching algorithm that finds the 1 to 10 related occupations someone can pursue with minimal additional preparation. By comparing the Logging Equipment Operators occupation to all other occupations' attributes (knowledge, skills, work activities, etc.), we found that it is similar to the following occupations: Excavating and Loading Machine and Dragline Operators, Surface Mining, Operating Engineers and Other Construction Equipment Operators, Earth Drillers, Except Oil and Gas, Railroad Brake, Signal, and Switch Operators and Locomotive Firers, Rail Yard Engineers, Dinkey Operators, and Hostlers. By converting occupation relationships into a network graph and measuring the centrality of each occupation, this occupation would create opportunities for people to transition into 5.0 other occupations (also known as outdegree). On the other hand, 5.0 other occupations transition into it, which gives you an idea of how specialized it may be. The path begins with Logging Equipment Operators.

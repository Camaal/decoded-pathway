To identify jobs that transfer from their previous job and experience, we created a matching algorithm that finds the 1 to 10 related occupations someone can pursue with minimal additional preparation. By comparing the Explosives Workers, Ordnance Handling Experts, and Blasters occupation to all other occupations' attributes (knowledge, skills, work activities, etc.), we found that it is similar to the following occupations: Captains, Mates, and Pilots of Water Vessels, First-Line Supervisors of Construction Trades and Extraction Workers, First-Line Supervisors of Landscaping, Lawn Service, and Groundskeeping Workers, Commercial Divers, Forest and Conservation Technicians. By converting occupation relationships into a network graph and measuring the centrality of each occupation, this occupation would create opportunities for people to transition into 5.0 other occupations (also known as outdegree). On the other hand, 5.0 other occupations transition into it, which gives you an idea of how specialized it may be.  "

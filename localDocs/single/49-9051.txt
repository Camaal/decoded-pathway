To identify jobs that transfer from their previous job and experience, we created a matching algorithm that finds the 1 to 10 related occupations someone can pursue with minimal additional preparation. By comparing the Electrical Power-Line Installers and Repairers occupation to all other occupations' attributes (knowledge, skills, work activities, etc.), we found that it is similar to the following occupations: Commercial Divers, Plumbers, Pipefitters, and Steamfitters, Bus and Truck Mechanics and Diesel Engine Specialists, Heating, Air Conditioning, and Refrigeration Mechanics and Installers, Boilermakers. By converting occupation relationships into a network graph and measuring the centrality of each occupation, this occupation would create opportunities for people to transition into 5.0 other occupations (also known as outdegree). On the other hand, 5.0 other occupations transition into it, which gives you an idea of how specialized it may be.  "

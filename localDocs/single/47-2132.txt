By comparing the Insulation Workers, Mechanical occupation to all other occupations' attributes (knowledge, skills, work activities, etc.), we found that it is similar to the following occupations: Plumbers, Pipefitters, and Steamfitters, Hazardous Materials Removal Workers, Structural Metal Fabricators and Fitters, Heating, Air Conditioning, and Refrigeration Mechanics and Installers, Boilermakers. By converting occupation relationships into a network graph and measuring the centrality of each occupation, this occupation would create opportunities for people to transition into 5.0 other occupations (also known as outdegree). On the other hand, 5.0 other occupations transition into it, which gives you an idea of how specialized it may be.  "

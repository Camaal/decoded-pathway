"A Plating Machine Setters, Operators, and Tenders, Metal and Plastic is someone who Set up, operate, or tend plating machines to coat metal or plastic products with chromium, zinc, copper, cadmium, nickel, or other metal to protect or decorate surfaces. Typically, the product being coated is immersed in molten metal or an electrolytic solution. . The Plating Machine Setters, Operators, and Tenders, Metal and Plastic  occupation fits a more significant career segment of Production Occupations. This occupation is considered part of job zone 2, described as occupations that need some preparation. You can find this occupation in the following industries: Wholesale Trade, Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services, Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services, Other Services (except Public Administration), Federal, State, and Local Government, excluding state and local schools and hospitals and the U.S. Postal Service (OEWS Designation), Manufacturing, Transportation and Warehousing. People who work in this occupation are responsible for the following tasks: Immerse workpieces in coating solutions or liquid metal or plastic for specified times., Adjust dials to regulate flow of current and voltage supplied to terminals to control plating processes., Inspect coated or plated areas for defects, such as air bubbles or uneven coverage., Set up, operate, or tend plating or coating machines to coat metal or plastic products with chromium, zinc, copper, cadmium, nickel, or other metal to protect or decorate surfaces., Observe gauges to ensure that machines are operating properly, making adjustments or stopping machines when problems occur., Remove objects from solutions at periodic intervals and observe objects to verify conformance to specifications., Maintain production records., Remove excess materials or impurities from objects, using air hoses or grinding machines., Examine completed objects to determine thicknesses of metal deposits, or measure thicknesses by using instruments such as micrometers., Rinse coated objects in cleansing liquids and dry them with cloths, centrifugal driers, or by tumbling in sawdust-filled barrels., Determine sizes and compositions of objects to be plated, and amounts of electrical current and time required., Test machinery to ensure that it is operating properly., Measure or weigh materials, using rulers, calculators, and scales., Measure, mark, and mask areas to be excluded from plating., Immerse objects to be coated or plated into cleaning solutions, or spray objects with conductive solutions to prepare them for plating., Read production schedules to determine setups of equipment and machines., Suspend objects, such as parts or molds from cathode rods, or negative terminals, and immerse objects in plating solutions., Suspend sticks or pieces of plating metal from anodes, or positive terminals, and immerse metal in plating solutions., Adjust controls to set temperatures of coating substances and speeds of machines and equipment., Monitor and measure thicknesses of electroplating on component parts to verify conformance to specifications, using micrometers., Operate hoists to place workpieces onto machine feed carriages or spindles., Position and feed materials into processing machines, by hand or by using automated equipment., Position objects to be plated in frames, or suspend them from positive or negative terminals of power supplies., Operate sandblasting equipment to roughen and clean surfaces of workpieces., Spray coating in specified patterns according to instructions., Clean and maintain equipment, using water hoses and scrapers., Plate small objects, such as nuts or bolts, using motor-driven barrels., Clean workpieces, using wire brushes., Mix and test solutions, and turn valves to fill tanks with solutions., Replace worn parts and adjust equipment components, using hand tools., Place plated or coated materials on racks and transfer them to ovens to dry for specified periods of time., Measure and set stops, rolls, brushes, and guides on automatic feeders and conveying equipment or coating machines, using micrometers, rules, and hand tools., Position containers to receive parts, and load or unload materials in containers, using dollies or handtrucks., Attach nozzles, position guns, connect hoses, and thread wire to set up metal-spraying machines., Perform equipment maintenance, such as cleaning tanks and lubricating moving parts of conveyors., Install gears and holding devices on conveyor equipment., Preheat workpieces in ovens., Cut metal or other materials, using shears or band saws..  They also know about using the following technology: Computer aided design CAD software, Compliance software, Spreadsheet software, Electronic mail software, Word processing software, Procurement software. Examples include Autodesk AutoCAD, Computer aided design CAD software, Hazardous materials management HMS software, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Word, Oracle Advanced Procurement. People in the occupation are comfortable using the following tools: Heat treating age hardening furnace, Hoists, Ammeters, Calipers, Levels, Micrometers, Workshop cranes, Jacks, Metal inert gas welding machine, Conveyor system, Pallet trucks, Processing tanks, Sand blasting machine, Air dryers, Galvanometers, Forklifts. For example, Bake ovens, Chain hoists, Digital ammeters, Digital calipers, Digital levels, Digital micrometers, Fixed workshop cranes, Floor jacks, Metal inert gas MIG welders, Monorail conveyer systems, Pallet jacks, Plating tank, Sand blasters, Spin dryers, Thermo galvanometers, Wheeled forklifts. They also tend to excel in the following abilities: Oral Comprehension, Oral Expression, Problem Sensitivity, Deductive Reasoning, Inductive Reasoning, Information Ordering, Category Flexibility, Flexibility of Closure, Perceptual Speed, Selective Attention, Arm-Hand Steadiness, Manual Dexterity, Finger Dexterity, Control Precision, Multilimb Coordination, Static Strength, Trunk Strength, Near Vision. People would describe them as Realistic, Conventional. They also tend to focus on the following opportunities at work: Achievement/Effort, Persistence, Initiative, Leadership, Cooperation, Concern for Others, Social Orientation, Self-Control, Stress Tolerance, Adaptability/Flexibility, Dependability, Attention to Detail, Integrity, Independence, Innovation, Analytical Thinking. They also value Relationships, Supportin the workplace. They leverage knowledge in Administration and Management, Production and Processing, Engineering and Technology, Mechanical, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Education and Training, English Language to do their job well. They employ the following skills Reading Comprehension, Active Listening, Monitoring, Operations Monitoring, Operation and Control. Their average day consists of the following activities Getting Information, Monitoring Processes, Materials, or Surroundings, Identifying Objects, Actions, and Events, Inspecting Equipment, Structures, or Materials, Judging the Qualities of Objects, Services, or People, Processing Information, Evaluating Information to Determine Compliance with Standards, Making Decisions and Solving Problems, Thinking Creatively, Updating and Using Relevant Knowledge, Organizing, Planning, and Prioritizing Work, Performing General Physical Activities, Handling and Moving Objects, Controlling Machines and Processes, Operating Vehicles, Mechanized Devices, or Equipment, Communicating with Supervisors, Peers, or Subordinates, Establishing and Maintaining Interpersonal Relationships, Training and Teaching Others, Coaching and Developing Others. To identify jobs that transfer from their previous job and experience, we created a matching algorithm that finds the 1 to 10 related occupations someone can pursue with minimal additional preparation. By comparing the Plating Machine Setters, Operators, and Tenders, Metal and Plastic occupation to all other occupations' attributes (knowledge, skills, work activities, etc.), we found that it is similar to the following occupations: Maintenance Workers, Machinery, Structural Metal Fabricators and Fitters, Patternmakers, Metal and Plastic, Crane and Tower Operators, Machinists. By converting occupation relationships into a network graph and measuring the centrality of each occupation, this occupation would create opportunities for people to transition into 5.0 other occupations (also known as outdegree). On the other hand, 5.0 other occupations transition into it, which gives you an idea of how specialized it may be.  "

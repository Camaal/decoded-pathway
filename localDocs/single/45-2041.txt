For example, 12-inch aluminum Kemper calipers, 6-inch plastic calipers, Apple corers, Belt conveyors, Binocular light compound microscopes, Cherry sizers, Color sorters, Crate openers, Cross belt sorters, Deformation testers, Diameter sorting machines, Digital calipers, Digital cameras, Digital refractometers, Digital surface thermometers, Diverter samplers, Drag conveyors, Electronic penetrometers, Firmness testers, Garlic presses, General purpose sizers, Grape sizers, Indented cylinder graders, Kick sorters, Meat probes, Onion sizers, Optical reflectometers, Overhead diverters, Overhead weighing systems, Paddle sorters, Peanut triers, Potato sizers, Probes, Rotary sifters, Seed graders, Shape sorting machines, Specific gravity separators, Tomato sizers, Utility knives, Vibrating screens, Weight sorting machines. They also tend to excel in the following abilities: Manual Dexterity, Near Vision. People would describe them as Realistic, Conventional. They also tend to focus on the following opportunities at work: Achievement/Effort, Initiative, Cooperation, Concern for Others, Self-Control, Dependability, Attention to Detail, Integrity. They also value Supportin the workplace. They leverage knowledge in Production and Processing to do their job well.  Their average day consists of the following activities Getting Information, Monitoring Processes, Materials, or Surroundings, Identifying Objects, Actions, and Events, Inspecting Equipment, Structures, or Materials, Judging the Qualities of Objects, Services, or People, Processing Information, Organizing, Planning, and Prioritizing Work, Performing General Physical Activities, Handling and Moving Objects, Communicating with Supervisors, Peers, or Subordinates, Establishing and Maintaining Interpersonal Relationships. To identify jobs that transfer from their previous job and experience, we created a matching algorithm that finds the 1 to 10 related occupations someone can pursue with minimal additional preparation. By comparing the Graders and Sorters, Agricultural Products occupation to all other occupations' attributes (knowledge, skills, work activities, etc.), we found that it is similar to the following occupations: Slaughterers and Meat Packers, Machine Feeders and Offbearers, Helpers--Production Workers, Packers and Packagers, Hand, Textile Knitting and Weaving Machine Setters, Operators, and Tenders. By converting occupation relationships into a network graph and measuring the centrality of each occupation, this occupation would create opportunities for people to transition into 5.0 other occupations (also known as outdegree). On the other hand, 5.0 other occupations transition into it, which gives you an idea of how specialized it may be. The path begins with Graders and Sorters, Agricultural Products.

They also tend to excel in the following abilities: Problem Sensitivity, Flexibility of Closure, Perceptual Speed, Visualization, Arm-Hand Steadiness, Manual Dexterity, Control Precision, Multilimb Coordination, Response Orientation, Rate Control, Reaction Time, Speed of Limb Movement, Static Strength, Dynamic Strength, Trunk Strength, Stamina, Extent Flexibility, Gross Body Coordination, Gross Body Equilibrium, Near Vision, Far Vision, Visual Color Discrimination, Depth Perception, Hearing Sensitivity, Auditory Attention. People would describe them as Realistic, Conventional. They also tend to focus on the following opportunities at work: Achievement/Effort, Persistence, Initiative, Leadership, Cooperation, Concern for Others, Self-Control, Stress Tolerance, Adaptability/Flexibility, Dependability, Attention to Detail, Integrity, Independence, Innovation, Analytical Thinking. They also value Achievement, Working Conditions, Relationships, Support, Independencein the workplace. They leverage knowledge in Mechanical to do their job well. They employ the following skills Critical Thinking, Monitoring, Operation and Control. Their average day consists of the following activities Monitoring Processes, Materials, or Surroundings, Identifying Objects, Actions, and Events, Inspecting Equipment, Structures, or Materials, Making Decisions and Solving Problems, Performing General Physical Activities, Handling and Moving Objects, Controlling Machines and Processes, Operating Vehicles, Mechanized Devices, or Equipment, Repairing and Maintaining Mechanical Equipment, Communicating with Supervisors, Peers, or Subordinates, Establishing and Maintaining Interpersonal Relationships. To identify jobs that transfer from their previous job and experience, we created a matching algorithm that finds the 1 to 10 related occupations someone can pursue with minimal additional preparation. By comparing the Fallers occupation to all other occupations' attributes (knowledge, skills, work activities, etc.), we found that it is similar to the following occupations: Sawing Machine Setters, Operators, and Tenders, Wood, Refuse and Recyclable Material Collectors, Helpers--Production Workers, Woodworking Machine Setters, Operators, and Tenders, Except Sawing, Loading and Moving Machine Operators, Underground Mining. By converting occupation relationships into a network graph and measuring the centrality of each occupation, this occupation would create opportunities for people to transition into 5.0 other occupations (also known as outdegree). On the other hand, 5.0 other occupations transition into it, which gives you an idea of how specialized it may be. The path begins with Fallers.

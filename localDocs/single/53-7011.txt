To identify jobs that transfer from their previous job and experience, we created a matching algorithm that finds the 1 to 10 related occupations someone can pursue with minimal additional preparation. By comparing the Conveyor Operators and Tenders occupation to all other occupations' attributes (knowledge, skills, work activities, etc.), we found that it is similar to the following occupations: Industrial Truck and Tractor Operators, Crushing, Grinding, and Polishing Machine Setters, Operators, and Tenders, Cutting and Slicing Machine Setters, Operators, and Tenders, Food and Tobacco Roasting, Baking, and Drying Machine Operators and Tenders, Grinding, Lapping, Polishing, and Buffing Machine Tool Setters, Operators, and Tenders, Metal and Plastic. By converting occupation relationships into a network graph and measuring the centrality of each occupation, this occupation would create opportunities for people to transition into 5.0 other occupations (also known as outdegree). On the other hand, 5.0 other occupations transition into it, which gives you an idea of how specialized it may be. The path begins with Conveyor Operators and Tenders.

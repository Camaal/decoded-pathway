To identify jobs that transfer from their previous job and experience, we created a matching algorithm that finds the 1 to 10 related occupations someone can pursue with minimal additional preparation. By comparing the Water and Wastewater Treatment Plant and System Operators occupation to all other occupations' attributes (knowledge, skills, work activities, etc.), we found that it is similar to the following occupations: Environmental Science and Protection Technicians, Including Health, Environmental Engineering Technologists and Technicians, Nanotechnology Engineering Technologists and Technicians, Geological Technicians, Except Hydrologic Technicians, Transportation Inspectors. By converting occupation relationships into a network graph and measuring the centrality of each occupation, this occupation would create opportunities for people to transition into 15.0 other occupations (also known as outdegree). On the other hand, 15.0 other occupations transition into it, which gives you an idea of how specialized it may be.  "

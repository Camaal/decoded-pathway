They also value Supportin the workplace. They leverage knowledge in Production and Processing to do their job well. They employ the following skills Operations Monitoring, Operation and Control. Their average day consists of the following activities Getting Information, Monitoring Processes, Materials, or Surroundings, Inspecting Equipment, Structures, or Materials, Making Decisions and Solving Problems, Performing General Physical Activities, Handling and Moving Objects, Controlling Machines and Processes, Operating Vehicles, Mechanized Devices, or Equipment, Repairing and Maintaining Mechanical Equipment, Communicating with Supervisors, Peers, or Subordinates, Establishing and Maintaining Interpersonal Relationships. To identify jobs that transfer from their previous job and experience, we created a matching algorithm that finds the 1 to 10 related occupations someone can pursue with minimal additional preparation. By comparing the Rock Splitters, Quarry occupation to all other occupations' attributes (knowledge, skills, work activities, etc.), we found that it is similar to the following occupations: Helpers--Production Workers, Welding, Soldering, and Brazing Machine Setters, Operators, and Tenders, Machine Feeders and Offbearers, Foundry Mold and Coremakers, Molders, Shapers, and Casters, Except Metal and Plastic. By converting occupation relationships into a network graph and measuring the centrality of each occupation, this occupation would create opportunities for people to transition into 5.0 other occupations (also known as outdegree). On the other hand, 5.0 other occupations transition into it, which gives you an idea of how specialized it may be. The path begins with Rock Splitters, Quarry.

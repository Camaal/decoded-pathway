To identify jobs that transfer from their previous job and experience, we created a matching algorithm that finds the 1 to 10 related occupations someone can pursue with minimal additional preparation. By comparing the Recreational Vehicle Service Technicians occupation to all other occupations' attributes (knowledge, skills, work activities, etc.), we found that it is similar to the following occupations: Motorboat Mechanics and Service Technicians, Farm Equipment Mechanics and Service Technicians, Automotive Service Technicians and Mechanics, Mobile Heavy Equipment Mechanics, Except Engines, Electric Motor, Power Tool, and Related Repairers. By converting occupation relationships into a network graph and measuring the centrality of each occupation, this occupation would create opportunities for people to transition into 5.0 other occupations (also known as outdegree). On the other hand, 5.0 other occupations transition into it, which gives you an idea of how specialized it may be.  "

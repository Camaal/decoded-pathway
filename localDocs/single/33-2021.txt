By comparing the Fire Inspectors and Investigators occupation to all other occupations' attributes (knowledge, skills, work activities, etc.), we found that it is similar to the following occupations: Fish and Game Wardens, Health and Safety Engineers, Except Mining Safety Engineers and Inspectors, Environmental Science and Protection Technicians, Including Health, Occupational Health and Safety Specialists, Range Managers. By converting occupation relationships into a network graph and measuring the centrality of each occupation, this occupation would create opportunities for people to transition into 7.0 other occupations (also known as outdegree). On the other hand, 7.0 other occupations transition into it, which gives you an idea of how specialized it may be.  "

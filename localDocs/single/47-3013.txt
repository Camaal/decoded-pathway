To identify jobs that transfer from their previous job and experience, we created a matching algorithm that finds the 1 to 10 related occupations someone can pursue with minimal additional preparation. By comparing the Helpers--Electricians occupation to all other occupations' attributes (knowledge, skills, work activities, etc.), we found that it is similar to the following occupations: Control and Valve Installers and Repairers, Except Mechanical Door, Electrical and Electronics Installers and Repairers, Transportation Equipment, Hydroelectric Plant Technicians, Hazardous Materials Removal Workers, Radio, Cellular, and Tower Equipment Installers and Repairers. By converting occupation relationships into a network graph and measuring the centrality of each occupation, this occupation would create opportunities for people to transition into 5.0 other occupations (also known as outdegree). On the other hand, 5.0 other occupations transition into it, which gives you an idea of how specialized it may be.  "

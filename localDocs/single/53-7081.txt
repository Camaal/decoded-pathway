They also tend to excel in the following abilities: Multilimb Coordination, Reaction Time, Static Strength, Trunk Strength, Far Vision. People would describe them as Realistic, Conventional. They also tend to focus on the following opportunities at work: Initiative, Cooperation, Concern for Others, Stress Tolerance, Adaptability/Flexibility, Dependability, Attention to Detail, Integrity, Independence. They also value Relationships, Supportin the workplace. They leverage knowledge in Mechanical to do their job well.  Their average day consists of the following activities Getting Information, Monitoring Processes, Materials, or Surroundings, Inspecting Equipment, Structures, or Materials, Performing General Physical Activities, Handling and Moving Objects, Controlling Machines and Processes, Operating Vehicles, Mechanized Devices, or Equipment, Repairing and Maintaining Mechanical Equipment, Communicating with Supervisors, Peers, or Subordinates. To identify jobs that transfer from their previous job and experience, we created a matching algorithm that finds the 1 to 10 related occupations someone can pursue with minimal additional preparation. By comparing the Refuse and Recyclable Material Collectors occupation to all other occupations' attributes (knowledge, skills, work activities, etc.), we found that it is similar to the following occupations: Structural Metal Fabricators and Fitters, Janitors and Cleaners, Except Maids and Housekeeping Cleaners, Maintenance Workers, Machinery, Crane and Tower Operators, Signal and Track Switch Repairers. By converting occupation relationships into a network graph and measuring the centrality of each occupation, this occupation would create opportunities for people to transition into 6.0 other occupations (also known as outdegree). On the other hand, 6.0 other occupations transition into it, which gives you an idea of how specialized it may be. The path begins with Refuse and Recyclable Material Collectors.
